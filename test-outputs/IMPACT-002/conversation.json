What error handling exists in the flow (try/catch blocks)?\n2. What happens if step \"Generate Mailing List Address\" fails?\n3. What happens if the external email API fails?\n4.

What Error Handling Exists?\n\n**Flow-Level:** The flow has a `Top Level Try` (Step 0) and `Top Level Catch` (Step 23) structure that catches unhandled errors.\n\n**Script-Level:** Mixed coverage:\n- ✅ \"Generate Temps\" - has try/catch but **swallows errors** (logs only)\n- ✅ \"Loop through Email Batches\" - has try/catch, logs and sets flag\n- ✅ \"Delete Temps\" - has try/catch but **swallows errors**\n- ❌ \"Refresh Audience Hash\" - **NO try/catch**\n- ❌ \"Generate Mailing List Address\" - **NO try/catch** (CRITICAL)\n- ❌ \"Email Audience Batching Check\" - sets error output but doesn't throw\n\n### 2. If \"Generate Mailing List Address\" Fails?\n\n**CRITICAL ISSUE:** This step has **no try/catch at all**. If it fails:\n- Error propagates to flow-level catch\n- Temp records created in Step 2 are **NOT cleaned up**\n- Database operations may partially complete, leaving inconsistent state\n- Mailing list address may be saved to memory but not to DB\n\n### 3. If External Email API Fails?\n\n- Retry policy is configured (provides some resilience)\n- **If retries exhausted:** Flow goes to catch block\n- **Mid-batch failure:** Partial delivery occurs - some recipients get email, others don't\n- **Orphaned Mailgun mailing lists** created but never used\n- **No response validation** - assumes success if no exception\n\n### 4. Will Record Be Left Inconsistent?\n\n**YES - HIGH RISK:**\n- `email_send.status` may show \"error\" but mailing list address exists\n- `email_temp` records remain orphaned (Delete Temps is in happy path only)\n- Mailgun may have mailing lists that ServiceNow doesn't know about\n- Batched sends have no checkpoint - cannot resume from failure point\n\n### 5. What Recovery Options Exist?\n\n**Currently Available:**\n- Retry policy on API calls (transient failures only)\n- Catch block updates record status to error\n\n**Missing/Required for Full Recovery:**\n- No temp record cleanup in catch block\n- No Mailgun list cleanup\n- No batch checkpointing/resume capability\n- No idempotency (re-run generates different mailing list addresses)\n- Manual intervention required for most failure scenarios\n\n---\n\nThe full analysis has been written to: `impact-analysis/error-scenario-analysis.md`",
