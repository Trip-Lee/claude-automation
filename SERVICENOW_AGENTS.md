| "flow", "workflow", "integration hub" | `sn-flow-dev` |
| "portal", "widget", "ui builder" | `sn-ui-dev` |
| "integration", "import", "etl" | `sn-integration-dev` |
| "acl", "security", "compliance" | `sn-security-audit` |
| "performance", "slow", "optimize" | `sn-performance` |

---

## Usage Examples

## Agent Characteristics

| Agent | Read-Only | Cost | Model | Primary Focus |
|-------|-----------|------|-------|---------------|
| sn-api | No | $0.035 | Sonnet | API Implementation |
| sn-flows | No | $0.040 | Sonnet | Flow Design |
| sn-scripting | No | $0.035 | Sonnet | Script Writing |
| sn-ui | No | $0.040 | Sonnet | UI Development |
| sn-integration | No | $0.040 | Sonnet | Integration Work |
| sn-security | Yes | $0.025 | Haiku | Security Analysis |
| sn-testing | No | $0.030 | Sonnet | Test Writing |
| sn-performance | Yes | $0.025 | Haiku | Performance Analysis |

**Notes**:
- **Read-Only agents** (security, performance) use Haiku model for faster, cheaper analysis
- **Implementation agents** use Sonnet model for code generation quality
- Costs are estimates per agent execution

## Integration with Standard Agents

ServiceNow agents work alongside standard agents for comprehensive workflows:

```bash
# Complex workflow combining standard and ServiceNow agents
dev-tools task sn-tools "Refactor incident API with improved security and documentation"
```

**Potential Sequence**:
1. architect - Analyze structure
2. sn-api - Implement API changes
3. sn-security - Security review
4. documenter - Update documentation
5. sn-testing - Create tests
6. reviewer - Final review

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Task Description Clarity
Be specific about ServiceNow features you're working with:
- ‚ùå "Fix the form"
- ‚úÖ "Fix client script on incident form that validates priority field"

### 2. Leverage Agent Expertise
Use specialized agents for their domain:
- Use **sn-api** for REST APIs, not generic **coder**
- Use **sn-flows** for Flow Designer, not **architect**
- Use **sn-security** for ACL reviews, not **security**

### 3. Test Everything
Always include testing agents in your sequences:
```bash
# Good: Includes testing
architect ‚Üí sn-scripting ‚Üí sn-testing ‚Üí reviewer

# Better: Includes security and testing
architect ‚Üí sn-scripting ‚Üí sn-security ‚Üí sn-testing ‚Üí reviewer
```

### 4. Performance Considerations
For performance-critical work:
```bash
architect ‚Üí sn-performance ‚Üí sn-scripting ‚Üí sn-performance ‚Üí reviewer
```

The second sn-performance validates optimizations.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Selected
If your ServiceNow agent isn't being selected automatically:

1. **Check keywords** - Use ServiceNow-specific terms in task description
2. **Manual selection** - Specify agent sequence in config (future feature)
3. **Review task** - Ensure task is ServiceNow-related

### Integration Failures
If sn-integration agent fails:

1. Check authentication credentials
2. Verify external system accessibility
3. Review REST Message configuration
4. Check MID Server status (if used)

### Test Failures (sn-testing)
If ATF tests fail:

1. Verify test user permissions
2. Check test data availability
3. Review application scope
4. Validate prerequisite steps
