# Session Summary: CLI Completeness & Performance Optimization
**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Version:** 0.10.0

## Objectives Completed ✅

### 1. CLI Completeness - Three New Commands

#### `claude cancel <taskId>`
- Cancel any task regardless of status
- Graceful cleanup with error handling
- Handles already-deleted resources
- Sets status to 'cancelled' with timestamp

#### `claude retry <taskId>`
- Retry failed/rejected/cancelled tasks
- Status validation before retry
- Re-executes as new task
- Shows original task context

#### `claude diff <taskId> [--stat]`
- Show git diff for task changes
- Optional `--stat` flag for summary
- Handles incomplete tasks gracefully
- Formatted output with visual separators

### 2. Performance Optimization

#### Architect Prompt Reduced
**Before:** 12 lines, verbose instructions
**After:** 8 lines, concise direction

**Key Changes:**
- "Create a concise implementation brief" (was "Analyze this project...")
- "max 3-4 sentences" for implementation approach
- "Keep it brief - the coder needs clear direction, not an essay"

**Expected Impact:**
- 5-10% faster architect phase
- ~3-5 seconds savings per task
- Architect currently 22.5% of total time

### 3. Git Manager Enhancement

**getDiff() Method:**
- Backward compatible with existing code
- New signature: `getDiff(path, baseBranch, targetBranch, statOnly)`
- Old signature: `getDiff(path, {staged, file})` still works
- Supports `--stat` flag for diffstat output

## Code Changes

| File | Lines Added | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| cli.js | +51 | Three new commands |
| orchestrator.js | +118 | cancel/retry/showDiff methods |
| git-manager.js | +26 | Enhanced getDiff |
| CHANGELOG.md | +85 | Version 0.10.0 entry |
| **Total** | **+280 lines** | **CLI complete + performance** |

## Testing

- ✅ New commands visible in `--help`
- ✅ Diff command handles failed tasks gracefully
- ✅ Error messages are clear and actionable
- ⬜ Full integration test (pending real task)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing Needed:
1. Run a simple task to test architect optimization
2. Test cancel command on running task
3. Test retry command on failed task
4. Test diff command on successful task

### Future Optimizations:
1. Reduce coder brief verbosity (51.5% bottleneck)
2. Model selection (Haiku for architect/reviewer)
3. Parallel test execution
4. Context window optimization

## Phase Status

**Phase 3.1: Hardening** (60% Complete)
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Resource cleanup  
- ✅ CLI completeness
- ⬜ Unit tests (pending)
- ⬜ Integration tests (pending)
- ⬜ System validation (pending)

## Key Achievements

1. **Complete CLI Suite:** All essential task management commands implemented
2. **Flexible Workflow:** Users can now cancel, retry, and inspect tasks at any stage
3. **Performance Focus:** First optimization toward sub-120s simple task goal
4. **Maintainability:** Clean code with proper error handling

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Task management
claude task <project> <description>  # Create new task
claude status [taskId]               # Check status
claude diff <taskId> [--stat]        # Show changes
claude approve <taskId>              # Approve and create PR
claude reject <taskId>               # Reject (pending only)
claude cancel <taskId>               # Cancel (any status)
claude retry <taskId>                # Retry (failed/rejected/cancelled)

# System
claude list-projects                 # List all projects
claude cleanup [--all]               # Clean containers
claude validate [--smoke|--full]     # System health check
```

## Documentation Updated
