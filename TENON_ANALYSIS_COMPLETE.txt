ANALYSIS COVERAGE
================================================================================

TABLES ANALYZED:
✓ x_cadso_work_campaign (Campaign - Level 1)
✓ x_cadso_work_project (Project - Level 2)
✓ x_cadso_work_task (Task - Level 3)

RELATIONSHIPS DOCUMENTED:
✓ Campaign → Project (1:N via 'campaign' field)
✓ Project → Task (1:N via 'project' field)
✓ Campaign → Task (1:N denormalized via 'campaign' field)

BUSINESS RULES DOCUMENTED:
✓ BR1: Save Current State of Campaign
✓ BR2: Save Current State of Project (cross-table)
✓ BR3: Save Current State of Task (cross-table)
✓ BR4: Set Segment if blank (Campaign)
✓ BR5: Set Segment if blank (Project)
✓ BR6: Set Segment if blank (Task)
✓ BR7: Copy Campaign Name to Campaign String
✓ BR8: Copy Project Name to Project String
✓ BR9: Roll Up Budget to Campaign (cross-table)

FLOW DESIGNER FLOWS DOCUMENTED:
✓ Flow 1: Close Campaign on All Associated Projects Completion
✓ Flow 2: Close Project on All Associated Tasks Completion
✓ Flow 3: Cancel Projects - Campaign - Cancellation Business Logic

SCRIPT INCLUDES DOCUMENTED:
✓ WorkClientUtilsMS (client-callable, segment-based access)
✓ Supporting includes identified

CASCADE EFFECTS DOCUMENTED:
✓ Bottom-up cascade (Task → Project → Campaign)
✓ Top-down cascade (Campaign → Project → Task)
✓ Bidirectional effects (Budget aggregation)

================================================================================
QUESTIONS ANSWERED
================================================================================

1. How are these tables related?
   → 3-level hierarchy, 4 relationships, denormalization strategy documented

2. What Business Rules connect these tables?
   → 9 rules documented, 3 cross-table operations identified and explained

3. What workflows or flows orchestrate actions across these tables?
   → 3 Flow Designer flows analyzed with complete logic and trigger conditions

4. What is the data flow when a Campaign is created?
   → 5-step process documented with field-by-field tracking

5. What cascading effects happen when updating records?
   → Bottom-up and top-down cascades fully documented with examples

6. What Script Includes handle cross-table operations?
   → WorkClientUtilsMS analyzed with segment-based access control

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

✓ Three-level hierarchical workflow with sophisticated automation
✓ Dual cascading mechanisms (bottom-up completion, top-down propagation)
✓ 9 Business Rules + 3 Flow Designer Flows coordinate complex state transitions
✓ State history JSON storage enables rollback capability
✓ Segment-based access control via WorkClientUtilsMS
✓ Direct Campaign→Task denormalization for performance
✓ Cross-table checks prevent orphaned state combinations
✓ Automatic campaign closure requires zero manual intervention
✓ Critical integration points identified and documented
✓ High-risk operations documented with mitigation strategies
