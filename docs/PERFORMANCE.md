- **Cost:** ~$0.10-0.15 per task
- **Efficiency:** ~70-75% actual agent work, ~25-30% overhead

## Performance Goals

### Target Performance
- **Goal:** < 60 seconds for simple tasks
- **Current:** 150-180 seconds
- **Gap:** 2.5-3x slower than goal

### Acceptable Performance
- Simple tasks (single function): < 90 seconds
- Medium tasks (multiple files): < 180 seconds
- Complex tasks (refactoring): < 300 seconds

## Bottleneck Analysis

### 1. Agent Spawn Overhead
**Issue:** Each agent spawns a new Claude Code CLI process

**Evidence:**
- Architect: 38.9s (including spawn time)
- Coder Q&A: 9.3s
- Architect clarification: 17.7s

**Impact:** HIGH - Every agent interaction adds spawn overhead

**Potential Solutions:**
- Session continuation with `--continue` flag
- Single long-running session for all agents
- Persistent agent processes

### 2. System Prompt Length
**Issue:** Detailed system prompts may slow down agent startup

**Evidence:**
- Architect system prompt: ~400 words
- Coder system prompt: ~300 words
- Reviewer system prompt: ~350 words

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Longer prompts = more tokens to process

**Potential Solutions:**
- Shorter, more focused prompts
- Move documentation to separate context
- Use prompt templates

### 3. No Caching Between Agents
**Issue:** Each agent starts fresh, no context sharing

**Evidence:**
- Architect analyzes entire project
- Coder re-reads same files
- Reviewer re-reads same files

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Redundant file reads and analysis

**Potential Solutions:**
- Shared file cache
- Context passing between agents
- Incremental context building

### 4. Sequential Execution
**Issue:** Agents run one after another, no parallelization

**Evidence:**
- Total time = sum of all agent times
- No concurrent operations

**Impact:** LOW - Some operations could overlap

**Potential Solutions:**
- Parallel architect + coder setup
- Async file operations
- Background pre-fetching

## Optimization Opportunities

### High Impact (Priority 1)

#### 1. Session Continuation
**Approach:** Use `--continue` flag to reuse sessions

**Expected Improvement:** 30-50% faster
**Estimated Time:** 90-120 seconds (from 150-180s)

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// First agent call
const result1 = await agent.query(prompt1);
const sessionId = result1.sessionId;

// Subsequent calls with continuation
const result2 = await agent.query(prompt2, { continueSession: sessionId });
```

**Status:** Not yet tested

#### 2. Optimize System Prompts
**Approach:** Reduce prompt verbosity by 50%

**Expected Improvement:** 10-15% faster
**Estimated Time:** 135-155 seconds (from 150-180s)

**Implementation:**
- Remove redundant instructions
- Use bullet points instead of paragraphs
- Move examples to documentation

**Status:** Ready to implement

#### 3. Shared Context Cache
**Approach:** Cache file reads and project structure

**Expected Improvement:** 15-20% faster
**Estimated Time:** 120-145 seconds (from 150-180s)

**Implementation:**
- First agent builds context
- Subsequent agents receive cached context
- Only re-read modified files

**Status:** Requires architecture changes

### Medium Impact (Priority 2)

#### 4. Reduce Iteration Limits
**Approach:** Lower max iterations from 20 to 10

**Expected Improvement:** No time savings (faster failures)
**Benefit:** Prevents runaway costs

**Status:** Easy to implement

#### 5. Parallel Operations
**Approach:** Run independent operations concurrently

**Expected Improvement:** 5-10% faster
**Estimated Time:** 140-165 seconds (from 150-180s)

**Examples:**
- Docker container creation + Git operations
- File reads in parallel
- Async logging

**Status:** Requires refactoring

### Low Impact (Priority 3)

#### 6. Model Selection
**Approach:** Use Haiku for simple operations

**Expected Improvement:** Lower cost, similar speed
**Cost Reduction:** ~30-40% cheaper

**Trade-offs:**
- Haiku: Faster, cheaper, less capable
- Sonnet: Slower, expensive, more capable

**Status:** Requires testing

## Comparison with Alternatives

### Direct Anthropic API
**Estimated Performance:** 60-90 seconds
- No Claude Code CLI overhead
- Direct API calls
- Simpler architecture

**Trade-off:** Requires API key

### Mock Mode
**Actual Performance:** 1-2 seconds
- No real agent execution
- File operations only
- Testing only

### Human Manual Work
**Estimated Performance:** 5-15 minutes
- Reading documentation
- Writing code
- Testing manually
- Iterating on feedback

**Comparison:** Agents are 3-5x faster than humans for simple tasks

## Performance Monitoring

### Current Tracking

All agent operations track:
```javascript
{
  duration: 14500,              // Total wall clock time (ms)
  cost: 0.0234,                 // API cost (USD)
  wallClockDuration: 14500,     // External timing
  modelUsage: {
    input_tokens: 1250,
    output_tokens: 340
  }
}
```
