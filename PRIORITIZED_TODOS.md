# Prioritized TODOs - October 21, 2025

**Current Version**: v0.9.1
**Current Phase**: Phase 3.1 (Hardening - 2/6 complete)

---

## üî• HIGH PRIORITY (Next 1-2 Weeks)

### Goal: Make system reliable and usable for daily work

---

### 1. System Validation & Smoke Tests ‚è±Ô∏è 2-3 hours
**Why First**: Need confidence system works before optimizing
**Impact**: HIGH - Catches regressions early

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `test/smoke-test.js` - Quick validation script
  - Runs simple task (add comment to file)
  - Verifies all agents work
  - Checks cleanup happens
  - Duration: <30 seconds
- [ ] Create `test/validation-suite.js` - Full system validation
  - Tests all 3 agents (architect, coder, reviewer)
  - Tests error handling (timeout, retry)
  - Tests cleanup (success, error, interrupt)
  - Validates file writing
  - Checks cost tracking
- [ ] Add `claude validate` command to CLI
  - Runs validation suite
  - Reports pass/fail
  - Shows system health

**Success Criteria**:
- Can run `claude validate` and get green ‚úÖ
- Takes <2 minutes to run
- Catches broken functionality

**Blocks**: Nothing - can do now
**Unblocks**: Confident changes won't break things

---

### 2. Performance - Low-Hanging Fruit ‚è±Ô∏è 4-6 hours
**Why**: System is 2x slower than goal (245s vs 120s)
**Impact**: HIGH - Users feel the speed

**Based on Performance Analysis**:
- Coder bottleneck: 126.4s (51.5%)
- Architect: 55.1s (22.5%)
- Reviewer: 45.5s (18.5%)

**Quick Wins (No Architecture Changes)**:

#### 2.1 Reduce Architect Brief Verbosity
- [ ] Analyze architect brief from test run
- [ ] Identify redundant sections
- [ ] Create concise brief template
- [ ] Test with simple task
- [ ] Measure improvement

**Expected**: -10-15s (20% architect improvement)

#### 2.2 Optimize Reviewer with Context
- [ ] Pre-load test results to reviewer
- [ ] Skip redundant file reads
- [ ] Streamline approval flow

**Expected**: -5-10s (15-20% reviewer improvement)

#### 2.3 Parallel Test Execution (If applicable)
- [ ] Run tests while coder is working
- [ ] Don't block on sequential test ‚Üí review

**Expected**: -5-10s if tests are separate step

**Total Expected**: **-20-35s** (8-14% improvement)
**New Target**: 210-225s (closer to 180s realistic goal)

---

### 3. CLI Quick Wins ‚è±Ô∏è 3-4 hours
**Why**: Improves daily usability immediately
**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Better UX

**Essential Commands**:

#### 3.1 `claude cancel <taskId>` command
- [ ] Stop running agents gracefully
- [ ] Cleanup containers
- [ ] Mark task as cancelled
- [ ] Show cancellation summary

**User Story**: "I started wrong task, need to cancel it"

#### 3.2 `claude status` command
- [ ] Show all active/pending tasks
- [ ] Show container status
- [ ] Show resource usage
- [ ] Show recent task history

**User Story**: "What tasks are running? What happened yesterday?"

#### 3.3 Improved error messages
- [ ] Better validation errors (missing config, etc)
- [ ] Suggest fixes for common problems
- [ ] Link to troubleshooting docs

**User Story**: "Error message should tell me how to fix it"

---

### 4. Basic Unit Tests ‚è±Ô∏è 6-8 hours
**Why**: Prevent regressions, enable confident changes
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Foundation for quality

**Critical Modules to Test**:
- [ ] `lib/claude-code-agent.js` - Error handling logic
  - Test timeout
  - Test retry logic
  - Test error classification
  - Test error enhancement
- [ ] `lib/orchestrator.js` - Cleanup logic

**Target**: 50-60% coverage (not 80% yet, but critical paths)

**Tools**: Jest or Mocha (already familiar?)

---

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next 2-4 Weeks)

### Goal: Professional polish and comprehensive testing

---

### 5. Comprehensive Test Suite ‚è±Ô∏è 12-16 hours

**Integration Tests**:
- [ ] Test full workflow (simple task)
- [ ] Test full workflow (complex task)
- [ ] Test error scenarios (API down, Docker down)
- [ ] Test interruption scenarios (Ctrl+C at each phase)
- [ ] Test approval/rejection flows
- [ ] Test cleanup in all scenarios

**Edge Cases**:
- [ ] Very large files
- [ ] Binary files
- [ ] Permission errors
- [ ] Network failures
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Timeout scenarios

**Benchmark Suite**:
- [ ] Simple tasks: <90s
- [ ] Medium tasks: <180s
- [ ] Complex tasks: <300s
- [ ] Cost: <$0.15 per medium task

---

### 6. Model Selection Strategy ‚è±Ô∏è 4-6 hours

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Cost optimization

**Strategy**:
- Architect: **Haiku** (fast, cheap analysis)
- Coder: **Sonnet** (smart implementation needed)
- Reviewer: **Haiku** (pattern matching sufficient)

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Add model selection to ClaudeCodeAgent
- [ ] Test Haiku for architect (quality check)
- [ ] Test Haiku for reviewer (quality check)
- [ ] Measure performance impact
- [ ] Measure cost impact

**Expected**: Similar speed, -30-40% cost

---

### 7. Advanced CLI Features ‚è±Ô∏è 6-8 hours

**Solution**:
- [ ] Parse agent responses for file paths
- [ ] Read and cache mentioned files

- [ ] Consensus detection tuning
- [ ] Streaming output (real-time agent thinking)
- [ ] Parallel agent execution

## üéØ MY TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS

### If You Have 6 Hours This Week:

**#1: System Validation (2-3 hours) - CRITICAL**
```bash
claude validate
# Runs smoke tests
# Verifies system works

- Measure 10-15% improvement

**Why**: System is 2x slower than goal. Quick wins get you closer fast.

**#3: `claude status` Command (1 hour) - HIGH VALUE**
```bash
claude status
# Shows running tasks
# Shows recent history
# Shows resource usage
```

**Why**: Daily usability improvement. You'll use this constantly.

## üö® ANTI-PRIORITIES (What NOT to Do Yet)

### ‚ùå Don't Do These Until High Priority Items Are Done:

1. **‚ùå Multi-agent expansion** (20+ agents)
   - Current 3 agents work fine
   - Not a bottleneck
   - Wait until testing is solid

2. **‚ùå Advanced features** before basics work
   - Agent pool persistence
   - Real-time feedback queue
   - ML-based consensus

3. **‚ùå Over-optimization** before measuring
   - Don't optimize spawn (it's 0.01s!)
   - Don't optimize parsing (it's negligible)
   - Focus on the 92.5% (Claude CLI execution)

4. **‚ùå Perfect test coverage** (80%) initially
   - Start with 50-60% on critical paths
   - Add more as you go
   - Don't block on perfection
