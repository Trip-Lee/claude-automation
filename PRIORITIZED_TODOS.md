---

### 1. Performance - Low-Hanging Fruit ‚è±Ô∏è 4-6 hours
**Why**: System is 2x slower than goal (245s vs 120s)
**Impact**: HIGH - Users feel the speed

**Based on Performance Analysis**:
- Coder bottleneck: 126.4s (51.5%)
- Architect: 55.1s (22.5%)
- Reviewer: 45.5s (18.5%)

**Quick Wins (No Architecture Changes)**:

#### 1.1 Reduce Architect Brief Verbosity
- [ ] Analyze architect brief from test run
- [ ] Identify redundant sections
- [ ] Create concise brief template
- [ ] Test with simple task
- [ ] Measure improvement

**Expected**: -10-15s (20% architect improvement)

#### 1.2 Optimize Reviewer with Context
- [ ] Pre-load test results to reviewer
- [ ] Skip redundant file reads
- [ ] Streamline approval flow

**Expected**: -5-10s (15-20% reviewer improvement)

#### 1.3 Parallel Test Execution (If applicable)
- [ ] Run tests while coder is working
- [ ] Don't block on sequential test ‚Üí review

**Expected**: -5-10s if tests are separate step

**Total Expected**: **-20-35s** (8-14% improvement)
**New Target**: 210-225s (closer to 180s realistic goal)

---

### 2. CLI Quick Wins ‚è±Ô∏è 3-4 hours
**Why**: Improves daily usability immediately
**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Better UX

**Essential Commands**:

#### 2.1 `claude cancel <taskId>` command
- [ ] Stop running agents gracefully
- [ ] Cleanup containers
- [ ] Mark task as cancelled
- [ ] Show cancellation summary

**User Story**: "I started wrong task, need to cancel it"

#### 2.2 `claude status` command
- [ ] Show all active/pending tasks
- [ ] Show container status
- [ ] Show resource usage
- [ ] Show recent task history

**User Story**: "What tasks are running? What happened yesterday?"

#### 2.3 Improved error messages
- [ ] Better validation errors (missing config, etc)
- [ ] Suggest fixes for common problems
- [ ] Link to troubleshooting docs

**User Story**: "Error message should tell me how to fix it"

---

### 3. Unit Test Coverage to 50% ‚è±Ô∏è 6-8 hours

## üö® ANTI-PRIORITIES (What NOT to Do Yet)

### ‚ùå Don't Do These Until High Priority Items Are Done:

1. **‚ùå Multi-agent expansion** (20+ agents)
   - Current 7 agents work fine
   - Not a bottleneck
   - Wait until testing is solid

2. **‚ùå Advanced features** before basics work
   - Agent pool persistence
   - Real-time feedback queue
   - ML-based consensus

3. **‚ùå Over-optimization** before measuring
   - Don't optimize spawn (it's 0.01s!)
   - Don't optimize parsing (it's negligible)
   - Focus on the 92.5% (Claude CLI execution)

4. **‚ùå Perfect test coverage** (80%) initially
   - Start with 50-60% on critical paths
   - Add more as you go
   - Don't block on perfection
